# Brisbane Open House

## Installation

```bash
npm i
npm run production
```

Built assets will output to `dist/`, which is not version controlled.

Timber uses `dist/manifest.json` to locate the latest built assets, even if they include hashes.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/main.yml` exists, but it's unknown if it works. The project can be manually deployed by copying files via SFTP.

Refer to `assets/js/myBuildingsApp/README.md` for React app deployment steps.

## Wordpress

### ACF

[ACF Sync](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/synchronized-json/) saves ACF field configuration to `acf-json/`. These files should always contain the latest ACF configuration and be committed to version control.

### Google Maps

Google Maps is embedded in `assets/js/app.js` using the `@googlemaps/js-api-loader` package.

The Google Maps API key is configured under the Options screen. The public api key is exposed to the frontend (JS) via `wp_localize_script()`.
